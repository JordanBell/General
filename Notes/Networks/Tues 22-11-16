SCTP - Stream control transport protocol
UDP with extra facilities

[Skips through several protocols]
  Imagine that you want to use UDP, but you want a bit more:
    Timestamps
    Time-sensitive delivery
      "Deliver this package within the next five seconds, otherwise do __ etc."

Multipath TCP
  Something we'll use now for the next ~five years
  More exciting
  Looks to be genuinely useful
  Allows us to set up a connection between two machines
    Uses underlying available routes, even if they're roots are different
  For example, may run across WiFi and 4G simultaneously (aweosme!)
  How it's done:
    In the SYN, mention that we're multipath capable
    If server is also capable, then successful handshake.
    Final ack acknowledges this
    Application only sees one socket, but multiple tcp connections are working
  If one connection breaks, ie lose phone signal or walk out of wifi range, the whole connection is still in tact
    Initially some packet loss before reconfiguring
  New, but growing
  Application do not need to change

Address Translation
  Mechanism to extend scarce IP numbers
  Incidentally provides some security
  Breaks the "end to end principle"
  Causes some people (such as Ian) to start shouting uncontrollably
