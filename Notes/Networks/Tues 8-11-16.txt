NTP
  Network Time Protocols
  Time synchronisation
  Does not operate on averages (consensus)
  Is about choosing exactly one clock and synchronising the local clock to a remote reference
  Other clocks are used to cross-check and provide back-ups

Stratums
  Stratum 0: Hardware, genuine atomic clocks, other stuff that is 100% accurate
  Stratum 1: NTP servers which have stratum 0 equipment installed
  Stratum 2: Speaks with Stratum 1

Definitions
  Rate: The rate of a clock is the frequency of maintaining an accurate pulse (an atomic process) which ticks. They follow on from eachother at the same rate (so that arbitrary units can be equated accurately to real time)
  Phase: The clock's alignment to some external timescale, usually UTC
